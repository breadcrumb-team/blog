They set up sign-ups for events. They gather feedback from customers or employees to make things better. Teachers use it for quizzes. And teams use it for all sorts of projects to collect research data. And it’s free!\r\n\r\nBut here's the thing. Once you have all those answers, what do you do with them?\r\n\r\nGoogle Forms gives you some basic charts, but they're not enough to tell the whole story. You might feel stuck if you want to dive deep into the data.\r\n\r\n### Google Forms analytics kind of sucks\r\n\r\n![](https://img.plasmic.app/img-optimizer/v1/img?src=61feb4de0d58833e48b6d0c4a518fcd4.png&f=webp&q=75)\r\n\r\nGoogle Forms is easy to use when you need to ask questions or get opinions. But when it's time to ask the right questions around your collected answers, it's not that great. The charts are simple, and you can't really dig deep into the answers. Plus, if you want to use the info somewhere else, it’s hard for you to get it out the way you need it.\r\n\r\n- **Not many chart types:** You get pies, bars, lines, and a few others. But what if you need something fancier, like timelines or grouped bars? No luck.\r\n- **Can't make it your own:** The charts you do get, you can't change much. You might want to make them look a certain way, but Google Forms says \"nope.\"\r\n- **Simple graphs:** The graphs are super basic. They can show you something quick, but they won't wow anyone.\r\n\r\nYou also only have a few ways to get your data out, and they're not very flexible. You can turn your results into a PDF. This is good for showing the answers, but not for playing with the data.\r\n\r\nYou could also export your data into a CSV. But then you have to spend time manually analyzing and building your own data viz. And if you want to get fancy with your analysis or make cool charts, you’ll hit a wall. Google Forms also doesn't talk to other data tools very well. You might need to do extra steps to get your data ready for serious number crunching.\r\n\r\n### Getting more from your Google Forms analysis\r\n\r\nImagine turning the data you collected for your cancellation feedback survey into awesome dashboards _incredibly_ fast. [Breadcrumb.ai](http://breadcrumb.ai/) is that super tool for your Google Forms. It uses artificial intelligence (AI) to make sense of numbers and facts. Think of it like a wizard that turns boring spreadsheets into cool pictures that show you what’s going on. It turns all your form data into cool charts that tell a story.  It's super easy to use and no need to be a computer wizard.\r\n\r\n![](https://img.plasmic.app/img-optimizer/v1/img?src=63556f4d327f69fc520bddff730bc754.png&f=webp&q=75)\r\n\r\nOne of the coolest things it does is mix different kinds of data together. It's like making a giant data salad where everything matches up perfectly. You won't have to scratch your head trying to figure out how things connect. Breadcrumb does it for you.\r\n\r\n**Here's a quick list of what [Breadcrumb.ai](http://breadcrumb.ai/) can do:**\r\n\r\n- Simply ask questions to generate the data visualization you need\r\n- Combine and analyze google form data with other types of data\r\n- Make reports that are fun to read and share.\r\n- Show yourself hidden patterns you didn't see before.\r\n- Customize your data viz just by telling it what you want\r\n\r\n![](https://img.plasmic.app/img-optimizer/v1/img?src=53fa960965e5fa684dd5650504368ddc.png&f=webp&q=75)\r\n\r\nBreadcrumb helps you make smart choices without taking forever. No one wants to spend days on this anymore. You can ask questions about your data and get answers fast without needing to be a data whiz.\r\n\r\nWhen you use Breadcrumb with Google Forms, you get to see your survey results in a whole new way. You can find out what people really think and feel by looking at the pretty pictures and clear charts. It's like having a data detective that shows you the clues. And the best part? You don't have to wait long. In just minutes, your Google Forms answers are turned into a dashboard full of insights.\r\n\r\n### Sharing your insights with dynamic reports\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to making big decisions, everyone needs to be on the same page. Since a picture is worth a thousand words, the best way to do this is by showing your team, clients, or bosses what's going on with your projects.\r\n\r\nWith Breadcrumb, can click around, explore, and really get what the data is saying. Change your workflow from writing formulas to chatting with your numbers.\r\n\r\n**Here's why interactive dashboards and reports are a big deal:**\r\n\r\n- They tell a story with your data, so it's not just a bunch of numbers.\r\n    \r\n- You don't need to be a data whiz to understand what you're seeing.\r\n    \r\n- They help you spot cool trends and patterns that you might miss otherwise.\r\n    \r\n    ![](https://img.plasmic.app/img-optimizer/v1/img?src=c0cb2cd463b7a704c3a871f465de7267.png&f=webp&q=75)\r\n    \r\n\r\nPlus, when you have to do a big presentation, like a Monthly Business Review, you'll have all the facts to back you up. And if you're tracking a bunch of different things, like how your ads are doing across different places, Breadcrumb makes it a breeze to see it all at once.\r\n\r\nSo, when you're ready to share your findings, everyone can jump in and see the same clear picture. That means better chats about what to do next. And that's a win for everyone!\r\n\r\n### Getting Started with Breadcrumb.ai and Google Forms\r\n\r\nIntegrating [Breadcrumb.ai](http://breadcrumb.ai/) with Google Forms is a breeze!

However, dealing with operations data can be incredibly challenging. \n\n**Data Quality Issues**\n\nDealing with missing, inaccurate, outdated, or inconsistent data can be daunting. These issues might lead to errors, biases, or misleading results in analysis and reporting.\n\n**Data Integration Challenges**\n\nOperations optimization often involves tasks like resource allocation, supply chain management, and capacity planning. These tasks require integrating datasets from multiple sources in different formats, making comprehensive analysis difficult.\n\n**Data Analysis Complexity**\n\nAs the business grows, so does the volume and complexity of the data. Identifying relevant and useful data for decision-making becomes harder, often necessitating the hiring of data experts to use advanced analytical tools for meaningful insights.\n\n**Data Interpretation Difficulty**\n\nSuppose you aim to enhance production efficiency by identifying and eliminating bottlenecks in the production process to boost throughput and reduce cycle times. However, navigating through various metrics, extracting meaningful insights, and drawing conclusions from multiple datasets can be highly challenging. This complexity is compounded when it involves conveying insights through data storytelling and visualization to stakeholders.\n\nThese steps require time, expertise, and a significant amount of manual effort, which can be overwhelming for many, especially those without a background in data science.\n\n### How Breadcrumb Helps You to Minimize the Work to Get Insights\n\nWith Breadcrumb, your AI-powered data analysis companion can help you simplify the process of analyzing operations, inventory, and order data. Here's how Breadcrumb transforms your data analysis experience:\n\n**Data Aggregation and Integration**\n\nBreadcrumb can seamlessly integrate and join data from multiple sources and formats, overcoming data silos and ensuring that all relevant operational data is centralized and accessible in one place.\n\n**Data Quality Assurance**\n\nIt can assist in identifying data quality issues such as inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and missing data through automated checks and validations.\n\n**Advanced Insights and Data Storytelling**\n\nBreadcrumb can automatically identify important metrics, patterns, and trends, and creates intuitive visualizations. The dashboard and visualizations can always be tailored based on your needs. It is crucial for effectively communicating findings to stakeholders facilitating better understanding of operational strategies.\n\n**Predictive Analytics and Regression Analysis**\n\nLeveraging machine learning capabilities, Breadcrumb can forecast future inventory and orders, also describe relationships between multiple variables such as location, order, cost…etc for you to further initiate operations strategies such as ensuring maximum productivity and cost efficiency.\n\n### Example Walk-Through and Tutorial\n\nTo illustrate the power of Breadcrumb, let's walk through a practical use case.\n\n**Use Case: Analyzing Operations Data**\n\nImagine you are an operations manager at a cosmetics company. You have two datasets containing operations data for the past year, including information on production volumes, supply chain metrics, shipping information and operational costs. You want to analyze this data to identify inefficiencies, optimize processes, and improve overall operational performance.\n\nSo how do you do it? Let’s dig in and see how easy it can be.\n\n**Import Your Dataset**\n\nFirst, log in and upload the dataset you have, super easy! You can ask questions on what you want to see, or let Breadcrumb.ai do the magic!\n\n**Automatic Visualization Generation**\n\nOnce the datasets are uploaded, Breadcrumb will join the datasets and handle the data cleaning for you to ask further analysis questions. Then you'll see charts, graphs, and tables showcasing key metrics such as total production volume, supply chain efficiency, and operational costs over time.\n\n[![](https://img.plasmic.app/img-optimizer/v1/img?src=1cee0eb497becb867f6c02cfbb74e5c6.gif&f=webp&q=75)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YzbEuPSeUQzsV6lJoLefj64DfexWzsKy/view?usp=drive_link)\n\nYou can change or add the widget by asking questions related to the dataset. For example, here I asked: What is the average lead time for each shipping carrier?\n\n![](https://img.plasmic.app/img-optimizer/v1/img?src=32a7097af21308f9b2be6c125bc6cdbc.gif&f=webp&q=75)\n\nIt’s quick and easy. It not only shows you the optimal chart to answer your questions, it also provides you with an explicit text answer.\n\n**Customize Your Dashboard**\n\nYou can always tailor the dashboard according to your needs. You can rearrange the widgets however you want to. Moreover, even though Breadcrumb.ai will choose the optimal type of chart for your data, you can change to any other type of chart you want!\n\n![](https://img.plasmic.app/img-optimizer/v1/img?src=5bd05a0b3f1689ecd67ca4ba3b0a3cd8.gif&f=webp&q=75)\n\nYou can ask even more in-depth questions. Breadcrumb.ai will provide you with the thought process and the answer you need. In the below example, I ask: What is the correlation between shipping costs and revenue generated?. No more than 2 minutes, it generated the scatter plot of the correlation between the two variables, and also provided a clear explanation of the relationship. \n\n![](https://img.plasmic.app/img-optimizer/v1/img?src=77205f7d0b73cdf0fc45b160633ba9fb.gif&f=webp&q=75)\n\n**Share Your Insights**\n\nWith all the powerful data visualizations and insights, sharing them with stakeholders has never been easier. \n\nEffortlessly embed any widget onto your website, reports, or slides by simply copying the embed link. This allows you to integrate dynamic visualizations directly into your content.\n\n![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeeyv884s-aE3cyAht9hKHkulGQ-fFyELmz-qwYsRKfX5Y-HI55gAonDhvyyX-zNE2G3DnwTxtn1lEsc7NhYdDPiQt2UqrrcoSP94liOKutc14PgBeVl1L6zGMX9IYAuX18kHdgZ3itHaSq4GAnVq-WvzW5?key=L3Bq8F5wJohCkLpiHgTrgQ)\n\nYou can invite collaborators to this dashboard with you\n\n![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfUfjCr4L-JXdoDjMK4expOs1YuXZGEjL7XxpuHt_cfs-Eq7Pd4mfWW_u8W8u1FFNKa2u3_P_7arkD3kOzEjLnajLy_LBltG66UQoPpOxUyqmovHS4iU7pMkKgeYJeKf3Z0BzXIDlQw0AIDDG3hnTpQXJnf?key=L3Bq8F5wJohCkLpiHgTrgQ)\n\nOr you can create comprehensive reports that include all the insights from your dashboard, complete with clear explanations and visualizations.

Centralized Data Analysis Across Multiple Categories\n\nImagine you’re managing multiple teams or departments—each with their own metrics and KPIs that need to be tracked regularly. With Groups, you can create a single space that houses several dashboards, each dedicated to different categories, teams, or projects. For instance, a marketing department can have one dashboard tracking campaign performance, while the sales department can have another focused on lead generation—all within the same workspace.\n\nBy allowing you to view and compare these dashboards side by side, Groups enables faster, more informed decision-making. You’ll be able to spot trends across departments, identify areas for improvement, and make connections that would otherwise be lost in siloed data.\n\n#### 2. Clearer Visualizations for Complex Data Sets\n\nOne of the biggest challenges when dealing with large datasets is maintaining clarity. Juggling multiple metrics across different domains often leads to a cluttered and overwhelming dashboard, which can obscure important insights.\n\nThe Groups feature tackles this head-on by giving you the ability to compartmentalize your visualizations. Each dashboard within a Group can focus on a specific set of metrics or visualizations, keeping things organized and easy to navigate. Want to track customer satisfaction by region, sales by product category, and website performance, all without confusion? With Groups, it’s possible—and seamless.\n\nBy breaking down data into focused, manageable sections, you enhance the clarity of each visualization, making insights easier to digest and share with your team.\n\n#### 3. A New Level of Customization\n\nWe understand that every business, team, and project has its own unique needs when it comes to data visualization. That’s why the Groups feature is designed to be as flexible as possible. You have the freedom to create custom dashboards for any use case—whether you’re managing different product lines, regions, customer segments, or marketing campaigns.\n\nYou can also customize the layout of your dashboards within a Group to ensure that the most important data is always front and center. Need to compare sales growth between two product categories? Place those dashboards side by side. Want to track operational metrics while monitoring the overall company performance? Now, you can do that without having to switch views or spaces.\n\n---\n\n#### Get Started with Groups Today\n\nWe believe Groups will revolutionize the way you work with data, helping you streamline your analysis, boost collaboration, and make smarter, faster decisions. This feature is now live and ready to use.  We've only scratched the surface, over the next while we will be constantly enhancing it with group level filters, queries, and more.

Traditional business moats in Media, built around integrated control over publishing and distributing content were commoditized overnight. New entrants like Netflix, Spotify, and AirBnB took advantage of the technology shift by aggregating distributed content. Massive fortunes in news, music, and video shifted from controlling the means of distribution to aggregating distributors and controlling the means of demand.\n\n![Analysis is the new media](https://img.plasmic.app/img-optimizer/v1/img?src=48e640b826c6df65a5a97be40401540f.png&f=webp&q=75)\n\n_Comparison of new and old integrated value in media.

Each tool built a moat by integrating inputs that required _both_ specialized software _and_ humans trained on that software. Companies had no choice but to build their own data pipeline and pick a tool for each stage in the process. E.G. Fivetran for ingestion, DBT for querying, Alteryx for pipeline building, PowerBI for visualization. Business moats revolved around owning these slices of the data pipeline.\n\n#### **Yet decision makers are still blocked from acting with data**\n\nData teams in medium and large companies hold immense responsibility. They determine who has access to data and which decisions can be made with it. What’s more, in the face of growing business complexity, shifting data sources, and increases in the amount of data, data teams are failing to keep up with business user demand, resulting in data requests taking weeks or months.

Though still early, data engineering and analysis tasks - once done solely by humans - can now increasingly be achieved with AI agents in real time. In mid-market and enterprise companies it takes weeks or months to ingest and transform data into personalized reports. Shifting human work to code automates analytics and reporting at the same time. What used to take months, can now take minutes.\n\n#### **The analysis moat is shifting to data stack aggregators**\n\nAs AI takes over human tasks in the analysis stack, value and defensibility shift from owning components of data pipelines to integrating them. This commoditizes them by shifting the ‘hard & valuable thing’ from building parts of the data stack to building the experience to interact with it.\n\n![The new data aggregators](https://img.plasmic.app/img-optimizer/v1/img?src=419379cfd440b8a9433027aa7440863e.png&f=webp&q=75)\n\n_The new standard in the data experience will be analytics aggregators_\n\nThe new experience for non-technical users to work with data is… new.

Traditional methods—email chains, meetings, and static reports—often result in inefficiencies, high overhead, and slower turnarounds.\n\nThat’s where an AI report generator for consultants, along with AI agents, dynamic data visualizations, and interactive reporting tools like Breadcrumb, can make a significant difference. By rethinking how reports are generated and delivered, consultants and agencies can provide better service, reduce costs, and strengthen client relationships.\n\n### Lower Support Costs with an AI Report Generator\n\nSupporting clients shouldn’t require endless back-and-forth communication. An AI report generator for consultants reduces support overhead by:\n\n- Automating responses to common client inquiries within reports.\n- Cutting down on time spent in meetings or clarifying data insights over emails.\n- Providing interactive weekly reports that clients can explore on their own.\n\nBy leveraging AI agents to handle repetitive tasks, consultants can free up valuable resources for higher-value activities.\n\n### Deliver High-Quality Data Visualizations\n\nClients demand clear, actionable insights from their data. Static PDFs or overly complex dashboards often fail to meet these expectations. Use AI reports to offer dynamic data visualizations that:\n\n- Help clients quickly interpret trends and key performance indicators.\n- Allow clients to ask follow-up questions directly within the report.\n- Ensure a seamless experience for both technical and non-technical users.\n\nBetter visualizations mean faster decision-making and more satisfied clients.\n\n### Boost Client Engagement with Interactive Weekly Reports\n\nStatic reports don’t encourage active participation. Interactive reports change the game by enabling clients to:\n\n- Dive deeper into their data with real-time exploration.\n- Generate follow-up questions and instant insights using AI agents.\n- Engage with reports as living documents rather than static deliverables.\n\nThis active approach enhances client understanding, builds trust, and fosters long-term relationships.\n\n### Simpler Agency and Consultant Workflows\n\nFor agencies and consultants, efficiency is key to scaling operations. Think about leveraging a tool that can help you manage client deliverables by:\n\n- Automating the creation of weekly reports, saving hours of manual effort.\n- Reducing reliance on business analysts for client-facing tasks.\n- Offering a plug-and-play solution that integrates seamlessly with existing workflows.\n\nThis streamlined process allows consultants to focus on strategy while delivering more value to clients.\n\n### Why Choose Breadcrumb’s AI Report Generator for Consultants?\n\nBreadcrumb’s AI-powered report generator and interactive tools are designed for modern agencies and consultants who want to:\n\n- Reduce operational costs without compromising on quality.\n- Deliver narrative-driven insights through engaging data visualizations.\n- Empower clients to self-serve their reporting needs.\n\n![](https://img.plasmic.app/img-optimizer/v1/img?src=875adfd29ddda8664764609c9252aeec.png&f=webp&q=75)\n\nBy offering tools that bridge the gap between static reports and real-time insights, Breadcrumb positions agencies and consultants as forward-thinking, client-centric partners.\n\n### See Breadcrumb in Action\n\n![](https://img.plasmic.app/img-optimizer/v1/img?src=97afcd8ff1e6cc0a63c446ccd52feff0.png&f=webp&q=75)\n\nCurious about how Breadcrumb’s AI report generator for consultants can transform your reporting process?

Creating a **self-service data product** is one of the most transformative goals for modern organizations. It means faster decision-making, less dependency on specialized teams, and broader access to insights. But achieving this vision requires a bold shift in thinking—one that might feel counterintuitive at first:\n\nTo build a self-service data product, you need to remove data experts from the equation.\n\nNot permanently, of course. The goal isn’t to eliminate their expertise but to design systems so intuitive and robust that their involvement isn’t needed for everyday tasks. Let’s break down why this matters and how to make it a reality.\n\n### **Why data experts become a bottleneck**\n\nData analysts, engineers, and scientists are crucial to any data-driven organization. But when every data request has to go through them, things slow down. Here’s why:\n\n1. **Dependence on specialists:** Non-technical teams often rely on data experts for extraction, cleaning, and analysis. This creates delays and stifles agility.\n    \n2. **Complexity of traditional tools:** Most data tools aren’t designed for the average user, meaning non-technical employees struggle to access insights without help.\n    \n3. **Repetitive requests:** Data teams spend a huge chunk of time answering the same types of questions—tasks that could easily be automated.\n    \n\n![](https://img.plasmic.app/img-optimizer/v1/img?src=c13c11617b40f9c3dca4624fc824740c.png&f=webp&q=75)\n\nFor a self-service product to work, these roadblocks need to disappear. Every user, regardless of technical skill, should be able to access and act on data independently.\n\n### **Principles of a truly self-service data product**\n\nRethinking self-service data means designing tools that are frictionless, accessible, and powerful. Here’s what that looks like in practice:\n\n#### **1. Design for non-technical users**\n\nA great self-service data product doesn’t assume technical knowledge. It prioritizes simplicity, with features like:\n\n- **Natural language search**: Users should be able to type “What were last month’s sales?” and get an instant answer.\n    \n- **Clear, intuitive data visualizations**: No need for an analyst to interpret charts.\n    \n- **Pre-built templates and guided workflows**: Making it easy to generate reports or analyze trends without starting from scratch.\n    \n\n#### **2. Automate the data pipeline**\n\nThe best self-service products eliminate the need for manual data wrangling. Automation does the heavy lifting:\n\n- **AI-driven data cleaning and transformation**: No more waiting on data engineers to format reports.\n    \n- **Seamless ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes**: Ensuring real-time, accurate data without human intervention.\n    \n- **Automated validation and quality checks**: So users can trust the data without needing expert oversight.\n    \n\n#### **3. Deliver real-time, dynamic insights**\n\nPeople expect instant answers—self-service data should be no different:\n\n- **Replace batch processing with real-time updates.**\n    \n- **Allow users to interact with data dynamically,** drilling down into reports without writing SQL.\n    \n- **Embed insights into the flow of work,** via Slack, email, or dashboards.\n    \n\n#### **4. Embed governance and security**\n\nSelf-service doesn’t mean chaos. Smart governance keeps things secure and compliant:\n\n- **Role-based access controls**: Ensuring the right people see the right data.\n    \n- **Embedded governance policies**: So users don’t have to navigate complex rules manually.\n    \n\n### **Real-world self-service in action**\n\n**1. Conversational data access**  \nA marketing manager types “Show me this week’s ad performance” into a dashboard. Instantly, they get a real-time graph with actionable insights—no analyst required.\n\n**2. Automated reporting**  \nStakeholders receive weekly reports automatically, reducing manual work and speeding up decisions.\n\n**3. Department-specific insights**  \nA sales leader sees curated metrics relevant to their team, with options to drill down or ask further questions—all within the tool.\n\n### **The evolving role of data teams**\n\nTaking data experts out of daily operations doesn’t mean they’re obsolete. Instead, their role shifts:\n\n- **Architects of automation**: Building the pipelines and tools that power self-service systems.\n    \n- **Data quality champions**: Ensuring clean, reliable data.\n    \n- **Strategic advisors**: Tackling high-impact initiatives that go beyond self-service tools.\n    \n\nBy stepping away from repetitive tasks, data teams can focus on solving more meaningful problems.\n\n### **Challenges and solutions**\n\n**Challenge:** Resistance to change  \n**Solution:** Provide hands-on training and highlight time-saving benefits.\n\n**Challenge:** Ensuring data accuracy  \n**Solution:** Automate validation processes to maintain trust.\n\n**Challenge:** Balancing simplicity with power  \n**Solution:** Involve end-users in development to ensure functionality meets their needs without overcomplication.\n\n### **Final thoughts**\n\nA truly self-service data product allows anyone—regardless of technical skill—to independently access and analyze data. Achieving this requires removing dependencies on data experts and designing tools that simplify and automate the entire process.\n\nThe impact?\n\n- **Faster decision-making**\n    \n- **Reduced operational bottlenecks**\n    \n- **Empowered teams that focus on high-value work**\n    \n\nBreadcrumb aims to achieve this by providing AI-powered, self-service data tools that make accessing insights as easy as having a conversation.","src/content/posts/self-service-data-products.md","4a28b3aa393b333a",{"html":560,"metadata":561},"\u003Cp>How often do you recieved a dashboard you don’t truly understand?

AI-powered reporting allows customers to ask questions, generate custom visuals, and uncover insights instantly — without developer support.",{"url":208,"alt":20},[252,173],"For businesses that rely on customer data — whether in **sales, customer success, or product teams** — generating accurate and timely customer reports is critical. Reports help track customer health, measure performance, and identify opportunities for growth. But as one company recently shared, the process of creating and managing customer reports is often more frustrating than insightful.\n\n### The pain of customer reporting\n\nA customer success leader we talked to described how their team relies on dashboards and reports to track customer engagement and retention. Their team needs to deliver weekly and monthly reports to both internal stakeholders and customers.\n\n> ### _“Our customer success team needs to generate reports for clients every week. These reports cover product usage, customer satisfaction scores, and renewal likelihood.”_\n\nThe company started using **Power BI** in attempt to provide this reporting service\n\n> ### _“We embed Power BI into our platform so customers can see performance trends in real time and access self-service reporting.”_\n\nAt first, this solution seemed to work — but over time, they realized that reporting had become a core part of the customer experience. Customers started asking for more detailed insights and customizations, but Power BI couldn’t keep up with the growing demands.\n\n### Where Power BI fell short\n\n1. **Manual effort** – Generating reports still required combining data from multiple sources, cleaning it, and formatting it before it could be shared. This created a significant operational burden.\n\n2. **Slow turnaround** – Every time a customer requested a new metric or a different data cut, the data team had to manually adjust the dashboard or report — creating delays and frustration.\n\n3. **Inconsistent reporting** – Even small changes to data sources or report formats often led to inconsistencies, causing confusion and eroding trust in the data.\n\n![](https://img.plasmic.app/img-optimizer/v1/img?src=8c9107cd4a8c85c03c868b2a85284d10.jpg&f=webp&q=75)\n\nUltimately, Power BI’s embedded solution wasn’t scaling with the business — or with customer expectations. Customers wanted **more control, faster insights, and greater flexibility** — but Power BI’s rigid structure made it difficult to deliver.\n\n### The hidden costs of Power BI for customer reporting\n\n1. **Development overhead** – Every time a customer requests a new report, a developer needs to adjust the Power BI setup, add new filters, or reconfigure the dashboard.\n\n2. **Limited customization** – While Power BI can display complex data, customizing reports to meet different customer needs often requires manual coding and adjustments.\n\n3. **Poor user experience** – Embedded dashboards don’t always align with the product’s UI, making it harder for customers to navigate and interact with the data.\n\n4. **Scalability issues** – As customer needs grow, the reporting framework becomes harder to scale, leading to bottlenecks and slower report generation.\n\n> _“Our customers started asking for more flexibility — they wanted to filter data differently, see new metrics, and customize reports to fit their needs. But every time we tried to adjust the Power BI setup, it required developer support and took days to implement. It became clear that the reporting process wasn’t scaling with our business.”_\n\n### How AI-powered analytics solves these challenges\n\n  \nAn **AI-powered automated reporting solution** can eliminate many of the headaches associated with customer reporting. Instead of relying on embedded dashboards that require ongoing developer support, an AI-driven approach allows for faster, more flexible, and more scalable reporting.\n\n![](https://img.plasmic.app/img-optimizer/v1/img?src=26de77639e1cfb544264ac0d836bd0eb.png&f=webp&q=75)\n\n  \n**1. Automated report generation**\n\nAI tools can automatically pull data from multiple sources, clean it, and generate customized reports — without manual intervention. Reports are automatically formatted and updated in real time, eliminating inconsistencies and saving time.\n\n  \n**2. Conversational reporting**\n\nInstead of searching through static dashboards, customers can interact with reports directly using natural language. AI-powered tools allow customers to:\n\n• Ask follow-up questions about the data (“What caused the drop in Q2 revenue?”)\n\n• Get real-time insights without needing to consult a data analyst\n\n• Drill down into specific metrics and explore trends dynamically\n\n  \n**3. On-the-fly visualization**\n\nAI tools don’t just provide answers — they generate customized visualizations that make sense for the question being asked. If a customer asks for a breakdown of customer churn by region, the AI will automatically generate the appropriate chart or graph.\n\n  \n**4. Reduced back-and-forth**\n\nBecause customers can ask questions and generate insights independently, the back-and-forth between customers and the product team is reduced.
