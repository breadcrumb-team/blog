You’ve just created a stunning data visualization that perfectly captures a critical insight for your team. Excited to share it, you realize you need to compile it into a comprehensive report first. Hours are spent formatting, adding context, and ensuring the data is up-to-date. By the time you’re done, the urgency of the insight has diminished, and the potential impact is lost. This frustrating process is all too common.  

We understand how important it is to share your insights and come up with business initiatives. At Breadcrumb, we designed to enhance the way you share and collaborate on your data insights. With these updates, you'll find it easier than ever to distribute, edit, and work together on your interactive dashboards. First, start with creating and customizing your data visualizations for your dashboard:

Sometimes, you need to take your data offline. Whether for presentations, reports, or further analysis, Breadcrumb lets you download your widgets in multiple formats, including PNG, JPEG, and SVG. Additionally, you can export the datasets behind these widgets as CSV files. This flexibility ensures you can work with your data in the way that best suits your needs.
