At Breadcrumb, we believe a report should be more than a static snapshot. It should be a story, built for sharing and engagement. That's why we've designed our platform to make presenting your insights simple, polished, and interactive.

Here's a quick step-by-step guide to presenting and sharing your reports in Breadcrumb.

## Step 1: Organize Your Insights Into Groups

Once you've created your insights, bring them together into groups. Groups let you organize related insights into sections, almost like chapters in a book.

Each group highlights a different theme, and the way you arrange them sets the flow of your presentation. This structure is what turns scattered data points into a clear story for your audience.

## Step 2: Add Final Touches With the Customization Panel

Before you present, refine your groups using the customization panel. Here, you can:
- **Edit titles** to make them clearer or more impactful
- **Add short summaries** that explain the "why" behind the numbers
- **Adjust chart types or displays** to highlight key points

These small tweaks go a long way in making your report easier to understand and more engaging to follow.

## Step 3: Choose How to Present

When your report is ready, select the group you want to share and click the Present button in the top right. You'll see three layout options:
- **Auto** â€“ Adds narrative summaries to each insight and reflects the priorities you've set. Great for storytelling.
- **Grid** â€“ A traditional dashboard style, best for scanning KPIs at a glance.
- **Stacked** â€“ A clean, single-column layout, perfect for scrolling through from top to bottom.

Pick the format that best matches your audience and your message.

## Step 4: Set Sharing and Access Options

Not every report needs the same level of visibility. Breadcrumb gives you control over how you share:
- **Private** â€“ Keep the report just for you or select collaborators
- **Organization** â€“ Share across your team or company
- **Public** â€“ Open your report for anyone to see

You can even embed reports into your portal, website, or customer platformâ€”either publicly or privatelyâ€”making it easy to put insights right where your audience needs them.

## Step 5: Present in a Storytelling Format

When launched, your report appears in a storytelling, narrative format. Instead of static visuals, your insights flow in a sequence, with summaries that connect the dots and guide your audience through the story.

And here's where Breadcrumb goes further: viewers can open a chatbot inside the report to ask questions and explore the data themselves. This makes your report interactive, engaging, and tailored to the people you're sharing with.

## Why This Matters

With Breadcrumb, reports aren't just about sharing numbers. They're about presenting stories, starting conversations, and creating connections.
