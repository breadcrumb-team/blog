This update introduces improvements to group features that make workflows faster and clearer. Users can see exactly where they are, move around spaces with ease, organize groups to match their mental model, and place insights where they belong without extra effort.


## View and Jump to Any Group
The interface now shows the active group clearly. This removes uncertainty and helps users stay focused when moving between insights or different parts of a space.

Selecting a group from the new menu pans the canvas directly to it. Scrolling to search is no longer necessary, creating a smoother and more natural way to navigate—especially in spaces with many groups.

## Drag to Rearrange Groups

Groups can now be reordered inside the new menu. Drag them into any order that matches the workflow or mirrors team priorities. This keeps spaces organized and easier to understand.

## Send Insights to the Right Group from the More Menu

The insight more menu now includes an option to send an insight to any selected group. This keeps everything organized without leaving the insight view, saving time and preventing misplaced items.
