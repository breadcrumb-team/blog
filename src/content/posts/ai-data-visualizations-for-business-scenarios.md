In today’s data-driven world, visualizing your data is key to unlocking actionable insights and making smarter business decisions. That's where Breadcrumb.ai comes in—our AI-powered analytic dashboards automatically transform complex data into easy-to-understand visualizations. Here are five powerful data visualizations you can chat and create with Breadcrumb’s AI data agents to tackle different business scenarios.

## Historical Performance Analysis: Uncover Trends Over Time

Understanding how your business has performed in the past is the first step in planning for the future. Breadcrumb.ai offers powerful line and bar charts to help you analyze historical data and spot trends over time.

When it comes to sales, understanding trends over time is crucial. With Breadcrumb.ai, you can generate a dynamic line chart that highlights all kinds of time range sales growth, like the example here. 

> #### "_Prediction of sales for each category for the next quarter"_

I simply typed in the prompt and in a few seconds, you can have the graph of year-over-year sales growth across different product categories. This visualization allows you to quickly identify seasonal patterns, top-performing categories, and sales dips that need attention—empowering your team to make data-backed decisions to drive revenue.

> #### _"Conversion rate by gender of each category"_

Segmenting customers based on their characteristics and behaviors is key to effective marketing. Breadcrumb.ai makes it easy to visualize this with a bar chart, by asking: Conversion rate by gender of each category, it will break down your customer base by gender and purchasing channels, and more. Use this visualization to tailor your marketing strategies, create personalized offers, and enhance customer loyalty.

## Variables Relationship Analysis: Discover Key Correlations

To optimize and strengthen the business, understanding the relationships between different variables is always critical. Knowing the relationships can help you with strong strategic decision-making. Breadcrumb.ai provides scatter plots that reveal correlations and interactions between key business factors.

Understanding how different factors impact one another is essential for making strategic decisions. With Breadcrumb.ai, you can use scatter plots to visualize correlations between variables, such as the relationship between shipping time and revenue generated for different product types. 

> #### _"What is the relationship between shipping time and revenue generated for different product types?"_

Here I asked: _What is the relationship between shipping time and revenue generated for different product types?_ This can help determine what you can improve on for each product type, like carriers, lead time, route…etc. Not only it generates the visualization for you, it also shows you the summary of the insights it has discovered

## Future Predictions: Forecasting for Better Planning

Predicting future trends is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge since it allows businesses to proactively respond to market changes, rather than just reacting to them. With Breadcrumb.ai, you can create advanced forecasting models using line and area charts to visualize upcoming trends. These predictive insights enable you to anticipate demand, optimize inventory levels, allocate resources efficiently, and adjust your strategy ahead of time—ultimately leading to better decision-making, cost savings, and sustained growth.

### Prediction for Future Stock Level

> #### _"Can you predict the manufacturing lead time for each product type? "_

Soon enough it generated a line chart that predicts future stock levels, which is a valuable tool for inventory management, helping businesses maintain the perfect balance between supply and demand. By analyzing historical sales data and identifying patterns in purchasing behavior, Breadcrumb.ai's AI-powered dashboard can forecast stock levels over a specific period. This line chart visually represents projected inventory trends, allowing you to anticipate when certain items might run low or when excess inventory could become an issue. With these insights, your team can make proactive decisions, optimize inventory orders, reduce holding costs, and avoid stockouts, ensuring a seamless supply chain and improved customer satisfaction.

After predicting inventory, you can also predict the future sales performance which is helpful for your sales forecast and overall topline. I simply asked: _Prediction of sales for each category for the next quarter._

> #### "_Prediction of sales for each category for the next quarter."_

By analyzing past performance and factoring in seasonal trends and market dynamics, Breadcrumb.ai's AI-powered dashboard forecasts sales trajectories for each product. This visualization helps businesses identify which products are likely to see increased demand, enabling them to adjust inventory, allocate budgets, and focus resources effectively.
