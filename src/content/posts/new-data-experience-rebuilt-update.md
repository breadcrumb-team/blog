At Breadcrumb, weâ€™ve always believed that analytics should feel dynamic, intuitive, and fun to use. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re excited to introduce a full **dashboard redesign** based on how real teams like yours use the product every day.

Itâ€™s a rethink of how people interact with data when they need answers fast.

The new dashboard layout brings everything you need within reach. It's designed for speed, clarity, and focus â€” helping you and your team get to insights faster.

Let's explore what's changed and why it matters.

## **Why We Redesigned the Dashboard**

Over the last few months, weâ€™ve observed how users build reports, switch between spaces, customize charts, and revisit previously generated insights. The patterns were clear: people needed more flexibility, less clicking, and fewer blockers between asking a question and getting a clear, actionable answer.

So we made it all more accessible â€” right where you need it.

## **Whatâ€™s New in the Redesigned Dashboard**

  
### **Left Panel for Chart Controls**

You no longer need to jump into separate settings. With our new **left-hand chart control panel**, you can instantly adjust filters, dimensions, chart types, and styles â€” without breaking your flow.

Whether youâ€™re fine-tuning a KPI card or exploring deeper trends, the tools are always within reach.

_The new left panel gives you instant access to chart controls and filters_

### **Control Bar for Managing Space Rules**

Managing a dashboard space â€” especially across teams or clients â€” just got easier. The new **control bar** gives you quick access to data settings, create new groups, and rules that govern how data is shown and shared.

Itâ€™s your command center for making dashboards work the way you want.

### **Restore Checkpoints for Previously Generated Insights**

Ever generated a great insight and wished you could go back to it later?

Now you can. With **restore checkpoints**, you can revisit and reload previously generated insights with a single click â€” perfect for iteration, collaboration, or simply reviewing your past thinking.

### **Redesigned Visualizations and More Chart Options**

  

Weâ€™ve modernized our visual components and expanded your charting options â€” so your reports not only look cleaner, they also tell the story better. New styles, improved defaults, and smarter visual spacing mean every chart is easier to scan and act on.

### **Improved AI Feedback with Steps and Calculations**

  

Transparency in AI-generated insights is crucial for building trust and understanding. Our enhanced AI now shows you **exactly how it arrived at each conclusion** â€” displaying the step-by-step calculations, data transformations, and reasoning behind every insight.

Whether you're analyzing revenue trends, customer behavior patterns, or operational metrics, you'll see the complete thought process. This makes it easier to validate results, explain findings to stakeholders, and iterate on your analysis with confidence.

## **Built Around How You Work**

  

This update is more than visual polish â€” itâ€™s shaped by user behavior.

  

From how you switch views and tweak metrics to how you manage multiple spaces, weâ€™ve made Breadcrumbâ€™s interface feel more natural, more helpful, and more powerful. **Everythingâ€™s justâ€¦ handier.**
