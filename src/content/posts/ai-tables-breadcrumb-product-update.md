Weâ€™re shipping a big set of upgrades that make building, exploring, and communicating data in Breadcrumb faster and more controllable than ever.

### Whatâ€™s New

**ðŸ”¹ AIâ€‘Powered Data Tables â€” Full Control**  
Generate tables from plain English, then refine with precision: add or remove columns, create calculated fields, sort and filter, and build pivots and summaries directly in the table view.

**ðŸ”¹ AIâ€‘Powered KPI Charts (Beta) â€” Customizable + Change Rates**  
Create KPI cards and charts with granular control over formatting, targets, and breakdowns. Weâ€™ve added changeâ€‘rate display (WoW/MoM/YoY) so you can instantly communicate trends. Currently in beta.

**ðŸ”¹ Simpler Group Rules with Tag Filters**  
Group rules now behave like clean, tagâ€‘based filtersâ€”no more complex expressions. Combine tags with AND/OR to match how your teams already think about audiences.

**ðŸ”¹ Synthetic Data Source Generator**  
Spin up realistic demo and test datasets in seconds. Define schema, size, and distributions to prototype dashboards and validate transformations safely.

**âœ” More robust data refresh** â€” Smarter retries, incremental fetch where possible, and clearer status messages.

**âœ” Visible AI generation status** â€” We now show a stepâ€‘byâ€‘step AI status next to the spinner while insights are being generated.

**âœ” Improved AI training context** â€” Richer domain memory and better scoping produce more relevant, consistent outputs.
