### _You don’t need to be a winemaker to appreciate wine._

For the last decade data tools have been built for data people - making everyone else reliant on them to align strategy with analysis. As a result, 80% of decision makers need ongoing support from an analyst or engineer to communicate facts, understand results, and justify budget.

![Traditional BI Tools](https://img.plasmic.app/img-optimizer/v1/img/896f1a5ba7de0dabc1f468e66954ac74.png?f=webp&q=75)_Existing leaders in the analysis space (e.g. Domo, Power BI, Tableau, etc.) aren’t made for business users._

Until now, their only solution has been to rely on data specialist experts at working with the language of data. But this disconnect is costly. It means that those who marshal the resources play a game of telephone that takes days or weeks to get results.

Our customers are everyone struggling to communicate, collaborate, and engage with data. From school administrators searching for correct class information to senior executives aligning department milestones with company strategic goals.

> ### The world needs a way to _engage with data_ that is _not_ _dependent_ on data people.

They struggle with translating the data they're provided into the language their colleagues understand and can act upon.

#### This is where Breadcrumb comes in.

We're the world's first _AI Native_ **data communication platform**. Breadcrumb is where anyone can turn data into a story that communicates their goals. It’s where budgets get justified, customers engage deeper, and strategy gets backed by facts.

Breadcrumb is a completely new way to interact with data. Easy, accurate, and personally aligned with where and how you operate.

We’re just getting started on this journey. We’re looking forward to your part in it.
