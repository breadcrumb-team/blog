Agentic reporting uses AI-powered reporting agents to watch your most important metrics, unify data from multiple sources, and deliver narrative insights your stakeholders can explore without waiting on an analyst or wrestling with a BI tool.

## Agentic reporting and why it matters

- **Faster decisions**: Agents surface timely "what changed and why" narratives the moment thresholds are crossed.
- **Lower cost to scale**: Replace repetitive reporting work with reusable, adaptive templates and always‑on agents.
- **Personalization at scale**: Tailor insights to each customer and stakeholder without maintaining dozens of dashboard variants.
- **Self-service exploration**: Business users can explore narratives, drill into drivers, and ask follow-up questions without waiting on analysts or learning SQL.

*AI Agents do the data work. Your job is to provide clean inputs and clear business contexts.*

## What "Good Data for AI Agents" Looks Like

You don't need a perfect data warehouse. AI agents excel at handling messy data as long as the data and context are well-prepped. All you really need are two things: **light standardization** and **clear, plain-English business contexts**.

### Light Data Standardization: Consistency Over Perfection

- **Use consistent IDs** across data sources: Keep `customer_id`, `account_id`, and `product_sku` uniform across Salesforce, databases, and spreadsheets.
- **Adopt predictable naming conventions**: They should be intuitive enough to work, but not so rigid that they slow you down. Example: you don't need to give every NFL team an ID; just keep their names consistent (e.g., "Los Angeles Rams", not "LA Rams").
- **Keep time periods consistent**: Don't mix weekly signups with daily revenue in your data analysis. Ensure comparable time granularity across datasets.
- **Structure and update cadence**: Update spreadsheets at the same frequency as database syncs (daily, weekly) so agents don't compare stale data with fresh data.

### Plain-English Business Context: The Foundation of Trustworthy AI

Business context is what separates accurate AI insights from hallucinations. When you provide clear, natural-language explanations of your data and business rules, AI agents interpret your metrics the way your team does—not according to their own assumptions.

- **Make context first-class**: Provide the "rules of your business" in natural language so agents interpret data consistently with your team's understanding.
- **Explain only the non-obvious**: In an order table, `customer_id` is self-explanatory. But `created_at` could mean when the order was created, when payment cleared, or when it was fulfilled. Spell it out.
- **Define calculation rules explicitly**: Avoid ambiguity in formulas. Write "Gross Margin = (Revenue − COGS) ÷ Revenue" or "Churn includes voluntary cancellations but excludes non-payment suspensions."

## Three-Layer Data Preparation Framework for AI Agents

### Layer 1: Light Standardization Across Data Sources

Agents work best when data from spreadsheets, SaaS apps, and databases share a common structure. Here's how:

- **Consistent identifiers:** Use the same `customer_id`, `account_id`, or `product_sku` across Salesforce, your data warehouse, and Google Sheets.
- **Common naming conventions:** If Salesforce calls it "Account Name" and your database calls it "company_name", pick one standard or document the mapping clearly.
- **Predictable update cadence:** Update spreadsheets at the same frequency as database syncs (daily, weekly) so AI agents don't flag false anomalies from timing mismatches.
- **Unit consistency:** Use the same currency (USD vs. EUR), region names (New York vs. NY), measurement units, and date formats across all sources.

**Key Principle:** You don't need perfect ETL pipelines or data warehouses, just enough alignment that an AI agent can join and compare data without guessing at transformations.

### Layer 2: Non-Obvious Data Definitions

Clarify fields that could mean multiple things. AI agents will interpret ambiguous fields incorrectly.

> **`created_at` in orders table** = when the customer clicked "Place Order" (not when payment cleared or when we shipped)

> **`amount`** = payment amount *after* discounts and credits, but *before* taxes and shipping

> **`region` in sales table** = sales territory (West, East, Central), not the customer's physical location

> **`status` in deals table** = stage in your sales process (not opportunity or probability); "Won" means revenue recognized

### Layer 3: Definition of Business Terms and Metrics

Define metrics and segments the way your team actually uses them—not how a database schema suggests they should be defined:

> **Active customer:** Any customer with at least one completed order in the last 90 days

> **Churn:** Voluntary cancellations only. Excludes non-payment suspensions, trial expirations, and downgrades to free plans.

> **Gross Margin:** (Revenue − COGS) ÷ Revenue. COGS includes product cost and shipping, but not marketing spend or overhead.

> **Enterprise deal:** Any contract ≥ $50K annual contract value (ACV), regardless of seat count or number of business units

### Layer 4: Custom AI Instructions for Analysis and Presentation

Tell agents *how* to analyze and present data for your business context:

> **When calculating win rate:** Exclude deals marked "duplicate," "test," or "practice" in the CRM; include only legitimate sales opportunities

> **When comparing time periods:** Always use same-weekday comparisons (e.g., this Tuesday vs. last Tuesday, not last Monday) to account for day-of-week seasonality

> **For month-over-month seasonality analysis:** Compare current month to same month last year, not to last month, to reflect true growth trends

> **When explaining revenue drops:** Break down by product line first, then by region, then by customer segment to isolate the root cause

> **Anomaly thresholds:** Flag any week-over-week revenue change > 10%, customer churn spike > 5 accounts/week, or support ticket volume increase > 20%

*With these clear layers, AI agents interpret your data the way your team would, without needing a human analyst to translate every question.*

## Practical Example: Preparing Multi-Source Data for AI Reporting

Let's say you have:
- **Salesforce CRM**: Customer names, deal values, close dates
- **Stripe/PayPal**: Transaction amounts and payment status
- **Google Sheets**: Manual cost-of-goods-sold (COGS) updates
- **Mixpanel/Amplitude**: Product usage and engagement metrics

**Without preparation:** An AI agent might report conflicting metrics—using Salesforce close dates for revenue, but Stripe payment dates, leading to date mismatches and incorrect trends.

**With proper data preparation:**
1. **Standardize IDs:** Map Salesforce `account_id` to Stripe `customer_id` to Google Sheets `company_code`
2. **Define "revenue":** "Revenue = Stripe payment amount (settled), matched to Salesforce close date, attributed to Stripe customer billing address region"
3. **Set cadence:** Update Google Sheets COGS daily (aligned with Stripe syncs), not monthly
4. **Provide context:** "Active product users = Mixpanel events in last 7 days (not last 30 days, as we define weekly retention)"

Now your AI agent can confidently join data, calculate metrics, and explain trends without ambiguity.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid When Preparing Data for AI

**Pitfall 1: Over-engineering standardization**
- ❌ Don't: Spend months building perfect ETL pipelines before you start using AI agents
- ✅ Do: Get 80% of standardization in place, then iterate based on what agents actually need

**Pitfall 2: Assuming AI agents "just know" your business**
- ❌ Don't: Skip context documentation, assuming AI will figure out what "Active customer" means
- ✅ Do: Write plain-English definitions upfront; it's faster than debugging wrong insights later

**Pitfall 3: Mixing time granularities**
- ❌ Don't: Compare daily revenue to weekly signups in the same report
- ✅ Do: Agree on time periods upfront—daily, weekly, or monthly—and stick to it

**Pitfall 4: Forgetting about change management**
- ❌ Don't: Change data definitions or structures without telling your agents (or your team)
- ✅ Do: Version your business rules and document changes so insights remain consistent and explainable
