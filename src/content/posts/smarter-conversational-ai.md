## Say hello to a more conversational AI that helps you create smarter reports.

Our newest AI agent is your personal data planning partner.
 
The upgraded AI helps you think and plan around the insight you want to create. Ask questions in plain language, and it now responds with better understanding, smarter interpretations, and thoughtful guidance on what to explore next.
 
**You can even ask for guidance and recommendations:**
 
• "Where should I look for drops in conversion?"

• "What might be causing low engagement here?"

• "What recommendations can you provide for improving our metrics?"

• "Can you suggest areas where we could optimize performance?"

• "Help me identify potential bottlenecks in our funnel"
 
It's like having an AI analyst on your team, helping you plan the right questions before you dive into building charts. The result? Faster, better insights without needing deep data skills.

## New and improved async widget generation
 
No more waiting around. Insights now generate in the background, so you can jump to other dashboards, start new analyses, or check on different clients and return when things are ready.
 
It's a smoother, more efficient way to explore data at scale.
