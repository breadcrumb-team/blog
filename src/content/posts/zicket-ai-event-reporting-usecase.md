### Overview

[Zicket.co](https://zicket.co), a Hong Kong-based ticketing and RFID solutions provider, supports some of the region's most prominent events — from large-scale music festivals to boutique branded activations. In addition to ticketing, Zicket powers RFID top-up systems that allow attendees to preload credit and transact seamlessly across the venue. *Note: examples used in this post are anonymized and does not reflect real client information.*

### The Challenge

Each event generates large volumes of crucial data: refill amounts, sales figures, transaction timing, and top-up location performance. The core challenge for Zicket was the manual, time-consuming, and ultimately unscalable process of compiling this raw data into clear, client ready post event reports.

> #### “Before Breadcrumb, pulling together client reports took time. It meant manually slicing through spreadsheets, building charts, and trying to tell a story with the data. It wasn’t scalable.”

### The Solution

With Breadcrumb.ai, Zicket has transformed its post-event reporting process, now turning raw event data into polished, visual dashboards in a matter of minutes. After each event concludes, the Zicket team simply uploads their CSV files containing the transaction data, and Breadcrumb’s powerful AI handles the rest. The AI intelligently detects key trends, automatically generates insightful summaries, and surfaces visually compelling insights without manual intervention.

Whether the focus is on understanding refill station performance, analyzing vendor sales figures, or examining transaction activity patterns across the event timeline, Zicket leverages Breadcrumb to quickly comprehend – and effectively communicate – the key performance indicators of each event to their clients.


A typical report generated by Breadcrumb might include a clear breakdown like this:

> #### “The bar chart illustrates the total refill amount by location, clearly highlighting performance across various top-up stations. Top Up 1B leads with 9,550 AED, followed by Top Up 2A with 6,330 AED. This visual representation allows for immediate identification of high-performing refill points.


Similarly, a heatmap of transaction volume provides a granular view of peak activity hours across key vendor areas, enabling clients to understand attendee flow and purchasing behavior throughout the event.”

By effortlessly spotting the top-grossing vendors and identifying potentially underutilized refill stations, Breadcrumb provides both Zicket and its clients with a clear, visual, and data-driven understanding of event dynamics – all without the burden of hours of manual data manipulation and analysis.

> #### “I just load the data, prompt it with what I need, and it spits out exactly the kind of report I’d usually spend hours creating. The AI understands what I’m after — and clients love how visual it is.”
