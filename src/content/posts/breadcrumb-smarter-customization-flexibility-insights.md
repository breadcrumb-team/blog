This latest update introduces several highly requested features, along with some key improvements to usability. From smarter customization options to more flexibility in how you arrange your dashboards, these changes are designed to help you move faster and focus on what matters most.

Let's dive into what's new.

## üè∑Ô∏è Custom Instructions: Smarter Ways to Shape Your Data

One of the biggest upgrades in this release is **Custom Instructions**. You can now add tags, filters, chart type changes, styles, and edits directly through instructions‚Äîgiving you a new level of control over how your insights are generated.

Each tag acts as a quick filter that instantly prompts the AI to regenerate your visualization. Instead of manually adjusting settings or reconfiguring inputs, you can let Breadcrumb handle the heavy lifting while you focus on interpreting the results.

This makes dashboards more interactive and adaptable, turning what used to be static reports into living tools that respond directly to your needs.

## üß© Resizable Insight Groups: A Better Way to Design Dashboards

We know dashboard layouts aren't one-size-fits-all. With the new **Resizable Insight Groups**, you can now adjust the width of InsightGroup components, giving you the freedom to create balanced layouts that fit your workflow.

Need to highlight a key chart while keeping supporting data nearby? Or maybe you prefer a more symmetrical design for presenting to stakeholders? Now you can resize with ease, ensuring every dashboard looks and feels just right.

## üß™ Batch Widget Generation (Beta): Speed at Scale

When you're working with multiple data points, creating widgets one at a time can feel slow. That's why we're introducing **Batch Widget Generation**, now available in beta.

With just one action, you can generate multiple widgets at once, helping you stand up new dashboards in seconds. This feature is especially useful for power users and teams that need to move quickly, experiment with different angles, or prepare for high-stakes presentations.

## üìä Axis Editing: Fine-Tune Your Charts

Small details matter when you're telling a story with data. That's why we've added the ability to **edit X and Y axis titles** directly from the Customize panel.

This gives you more flexibility to label charts clearly, align with your company's preferred terminology, or tailor insights for specific audiences. It's a simple change, but one that can make a big difference in clarity and communication.

Whether you need to clarify units, add context, or match your organization's terminology, you can now customize axis labels with just a few clicks. This level of control helps ensure your visualizations are both accurate and easily understood by your audience.


## üîÄ Independent Panels & Focus Mode: More Control Over Your Workspace

One of the most requested usability improvements is finally here:

- The Customize panel (left) and Chat panel (right) can now be opened independently
- Both default to open, but you can keep only one active for a cleaner view
- And for those moments when you really want to dig in‚Äîdouble-clicking an insight closes both panels, giving you maximum space to pan, zoom, and explore your canvas

This update gives you full control over how you work with Breadcrumb, whether you're fine-tuning details or exploring the big picture.

## Why These Updates Matter

Each of these updates is about removing friction and giving you more flexibility:

- **Custom Instructions** turn dashboards into living, breathing reports
- **Resizable Insight Groups** let you design layouts that match your workflow
- **Batch Widget Generation** accelerates experimentation and setup
- **Axis Editing** ensures your insights are clear and precise
- **Independent Panels and Focus Mode** put you in control of your workspace

Together, they represent another step toward our vision of making Breadcrumb the most intuitive and powerful way for business teams to explore, share, and act on data.

## What's Next

We're continuing to iterate based on your feedback. The Batch Widget Generation feature is in beta, and we'd love to hear how it works for you. We're also exploring deeper customization options, smarter AI-driven insight suggestions, and new ways to collaborate directly within Breadcrumb.
