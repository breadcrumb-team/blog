### What happens when you combine two of the most flexible tools available? 

You get a powerhouse of data visualization and decision-making capabilities that's suitable for almost any scenario. Integrating Airtable with Breadcrumb instantly provides a solid foundation into an experience that takes your insights to the next level.

### Why We Integrated with Airtable

Airtable is a popular and versatile platform that merges the simplicity of a spreadsheet with the power of a database. It's widely used by teams and individuals for a variety of tasks such as project management, content calendars, customer relationship management, and more. Each of these use cases is distinct, yet they all fit perfectly within Airtable’s flexible framework. Often, multiple use cases coexist within the same base, creating a rich tapestry of data.

However, the current Airtable data visualization extensions offer only limited functionality with basic, generic charts. When it comes to building dashboards around diverse data, flexible analysis, and beautiful visualizations, Breadcrumb is here to provide that. Breadcrumb enhances this workflow, making your data not just accessible but also actionable and visually engaging to your stakeholders.

### Why Use Breadcrumb with Airtable for Dashboards

**Combine Business Data from Multiple Sources**

With Breadcrumb, you can integrate data from various business sources alongside your Airtable data. This ability allows for a comprehensive view of your operations, providing deeper insights and understanding.

For example, merge data from your Airtable sign-up form and your Stripe account to get a full picture of your customer’s buying journey. Understand customer behavior, purchasing patterns, and engagement levels by viewing all relevant data in one place.

By combining multiple data sources, you can uncover correlations and trends that might not be visible when looking at individual data sets. This integration supports more informed and strategic decision-making.

**Select Different Bases and Tables**

Breadcrumb allows you to choose specific bases and tables within Airtable to visualize in your dashboards. This flexibility ensures that you can focus on the most relevant data for your needs.

Tailor your dashboards to display data from multiple bases and tables, creating a more organized and efficient way to manage and analyze your information. This capability is especially useful for businesses with complex data structures or multiple projects.

By selecting and combining data from different bases and tables, you can perform more contextual and relevant analyses, leading to better insights and outcomes.

**Flexible Dashboards that Scale with Your Data**

Breadcrumb offers seamless data synchronization, ensuring your dashboards consistently display the latest information from your Airtable bases. As your Airtable base expands and evolves, Breadcrumb’s adaptable dashboards adjust to accommodate new data and changing needs, guaranteeing that your visualization tools grow alongside your business. You can easily remove and add new bases as projects emerge, avoiding limitations of being confined to a single source or using dashboards that don’t scale.

Breadcrumb ensures your dashboards are agile, seamlessly integrating various data sources like Airtable, spreadsheets, or other databases, providing unparalleled flexibility.
