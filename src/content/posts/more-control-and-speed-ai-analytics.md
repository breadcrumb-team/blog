#### Group & Space-Level AI Rules
 
You can now set privacy, branding, and data segmentation rules at both the group and space level without technical middleware.

![Space AI Rules](/blog/images/breadcrumb-space-ai-rules.png)
 
Apply a rule to set the color palette of the space to always reflect your customer's brand. 
 

Your data covers every team, but you only want to analyze the New England Patriots. Simply apply a rule on that space to focus insights only on them.
 
 
**Other examples:**
You might have performance metrics from several live events, but you're only interested in the one held in Las Vegas, Apply a rule using an event ID to focus your space on just that data.

Set insights to only show data for specific demographic (e.g., VIP guests, first-time buyers, or returning customers.

Narrow results to a specific timeline within a group.

### Widget & Space Cloning
Save time and stay consistent. Duplicate custom widgets or entire spaces with ease.

Example: You have nutrition insights built for your UK marketing and product teams. Now you can duplicate the space, adjust for U.S. data, and instantly share it with the U.S. team.
 
### SQL Display for Full Transparency
See the exact SQL powering every analysis and insight. Validate, troubleshoot, and be confident your data is correctly queried right from the dashboard.
