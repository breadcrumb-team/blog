**Google Forms is super handy.** People pick it for lots of reasons.

They make surveys to see what folks think. They set up sign-ups for events. They gather feedback from customers or employees to make things better. Teachers use it for quizzes. And teams use it for all sorts of projects to collect research data. And it’s free!

But here's the thing. Once you have all those answers, what do you do with them?

Google Forms gives you some basic charts, but they're not enough to tell the whole story. You might feel stuck if you want to dive deep into the data.

### Google Forms analytics kind of sucks

Google Forms is easy to use when you need to ask questions or get opinions. But when it's time to ask the right questions around your collected answers, it's not that great. The charts are simple, and you can't really dig deep into the answers. Plus, if you want to use the info somewhere else, it’s hard for you to get it out the way you need it.

- **Not many chart types:** You get pies, bars, lines, and a few others. But what if you need something fancier, like timelines or grouped bars? No luck.
- **Can't make it your own:** The charts you do get, you can't change much. You might want to make them look a certain way, but Google Forms says "nope."
- **Simple graphs:** The graphs are super basic. They can show you something quick, but they won't wow anyone.

You also only have a few ways to get your data out, and they're not very flexible. You can turn your results into a PDF. This is good for showing the answers, but not for playing with the data.

You could also export your data into a CSV. But then you have to spend time manually analyzing and building your own data viz. And if you want to get fancy with your analysis or make cool charts, you’ll hit a wall. Google Forms also doesn't talk to other data tools very well. You might need to do extra steps to get your data ready for serious number crunching.

### Getting more from your Google Forms analysis

Imagine turning the data you collected for your cancellation feedback survey into awesome dashboards _incredibly_ fast. [Breadcrumb.ai](http://breadcrumb.ai/) is that super tool for your Google Forms. It uses artificial intelligence (AI) to make sense of numbers and facts. Think of it like a wizard that turns boring spreadsheets into cool pictures that show you what’s going on. It turns all your form data into cool charts that tell a story.  It's super easy to use and no need to be a computer wizard.
