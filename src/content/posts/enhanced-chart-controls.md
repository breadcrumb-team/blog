We're excited to unveil a powerful new feature designed to revolutionize your AI data analytics experience: Customizable Panel. Breadcrumb has always been about simplifying complex data analysis, and now, with the customizable panel, we're putting even more control in your hands.

### What Are Customizable Panels?

Imagine having the ability to adjust and fine-tune your data visualizations instantly, without any technical expertise. That's exactly what Customizable Panels offer. Whether you're a seasoned data analyst or new to data visualization, these panels empower you to:

- Instant customized change: Easily changing the charts type, labels and legend to create the perfect layout for your analysis.
    
- Real-time updates: Make changes on the fly and see your visualizations update instantly, ensuring you always have the most current insights.
    
- Personalized views: Tailor each panel to focus on the specific metrics or trends that matter most to you or your team.
    

### How It Works

First, you can change the chart types based on the data and your needs in a second.

After deciding the type of the chart, you can invert the axis, put on the chart data labels to make the visualizations even more clear and easier to read, and decide the position of the legend.

Moreover, you can also change the labels of x-axis and y-axis, as well as the scale of the axis. For example, I changed the x-axis label to “Date”, and changed the interval from 20000 to 10000 and 40000. Other than changing the label of the axis, you can also change the format of the labels. You can make them as default from the dataset, or integers, decimals, scientific, and exact.
