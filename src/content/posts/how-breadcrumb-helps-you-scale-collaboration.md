We’ve just launched one of our most requested features—support for multiple organizations in Breadcrumb. Now, teams can collaborate more effectively, stay organized across departments or clients, and manage data with precision.

### Why We Built This

As our users grew, so did their needs. Teams wanted to separate workspaces by department. Agencies needed to manage multiple clients from a single account. And everyone wanted a better way to share insights without losing control over visibility.

This release is built for them—and for you.

### What’s New

**🔹 Multiple Organizations**  
Create separate orgs for each team, client, or business unit. Clean, simple, and easy to manage.

**🔹 Team Invites**  
Add teammates with just an email. They’ll get instant access to the right org and the workspaces within.

**🔹 Shared + Private Workspaces**  
Want to keep a draft private before sharing it with your team? You can now choose whether a report, dashboard, or insight is shared with the org or kept private to you.

**🔹 Centralized Data Sources**  
Connect your data once, and make it accessible to the whole org. No more duplicate setups or asking who owns the data connection.

**🔹 Permission Controls**  
Fine-tune access levels across orgs and reports. Perfect for larger teams or when you want to keep certain insights view-only.

### Who This Is For

- Startups growing their team and separating work by department  
- Agencies juggling multiple clients and needing distinct spaces  
- Ops, marketing, sales, and IT leaders working with cross-functional collaborators  
- Anyone who’s tired of managing reports in silos

This release marks a big step toward making Breadcrumb the most intuitive, collaborative way to work with data.  
If you’ve ever said “Wait, who has access to this?”—this one’s for you.

### How To Get Started

Log in to [Breadcrumb](https://app.breadcrumb.ai) and head to your **Settings**, create a new organization, and start inviting your team. If you're already using Breadcrumb, your existing setup has been migrated into your first org—we've made the transition seamless.
