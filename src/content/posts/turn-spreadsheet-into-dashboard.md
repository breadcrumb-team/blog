### The old way of building dashboards

A year ago it took hours to turn Excel and Google spreadsheets into interactive, shareable dashboards. And even then, the technology didn’t exist to interact with your data.

The old workflow required planning a dashboard structure, analyzing data using pivot tables, thinking through how you’re going to visualize data, and hacking in dynamic visualizes using pseudo-code.

**Traditional steps in getting insights from data**

1. Manual Raw Data Table Creation
2. Fumbling Through Data Import in Excel
3. Tackling Workbook Setup Manually
4. Endless Hours Spent on Manual Analysis
5. Visualizations Lacking Depth
6. Laboriously Building Excel Dashboards
7. Cookie-Cutter Dashboard Customization
8. Screenshotting Metrics for Sharing

Unless you’re a master business analyst, building dashboards the old way was guaranteed to take hours if not days of your limited schedule.

### A new way with AI

But now, using Breadcrumb, you can use AI to perform the entire data workflow for you.

No more dealing with complex excel formulas, spending hours messing with pivot tables, making sure you’re filtering the right data to get to the result you need.
